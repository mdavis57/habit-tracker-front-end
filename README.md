habit-tracker

Overview

My project will be a habit tracker which will enable users to track their progress with habits they wish to start or break. Users will be able to create their own sub-categories for better organization, as well as create personal incentives upfront for when they reach their chosen milestones. The application will have capability for personal journal entries with optional prompts to keep the user engaged and in tune with their thoughts along the way, for better self reflection. Users will be able to review their progress through data and visual representation, and reviewing past journal entries.

This app is for anyone striving to better themselves. This habit tracking application will be an excellent tool to help the user gain the organization and motivation necessary to work toward their personal goals.
